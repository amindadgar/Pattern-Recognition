## HW1 Codes description:
- **Question no2:**<br>
  Generate 100000, n dimension uniform i.i.d. random variables and calculate the volume of the n dimension shape of it.
  *Answer:* 50, 100, 200 and 1000 dimension iid uniform random variables was created. The graphs were plotted. 
- **Question no3:** <br>
  calculate the probability functions, ```P(Y)```, ```P(Y|X)``` using the joint probability function ```P(X,Y)```. Also plot the density functions of thoes probability. <br>
  
 
   *TODO:* write P(X,Y) function.
 
- **Question no4:** <br>
   (a) Calculate the eignvalue and the eignvectors of The given covariance matrix. <br>
   (b) Generate 200 points using the distribution ```Normal(0,Cov_matrix)```. Plot the data into 2D graph, Also project the Covariance vectors on it.
  
   *TODO:* write Covariance matrix.

- **Question no5:** <br>
   (a) Using the two i.i.d ```X1```,```X2``` random variables with distribution of uniform(0,1) with feature sizes of 2, Given ```Y=X1+X2``` Calculate ```P(Y)``` and ```P(X1|Y)``` and also plot the density functions of thoes. <br>
   (b) Re-calculate part a, using ```X1```,```X2``` with the distribution Normal(0,1).
 
 # Notes:
 - i.i.d stands for independece and identical distribution
